# Image-Processing
A repository which features image processing algorithms, of particular use for medical image analysis. The first python file (EDT.py) is a Euclidean distance transform, which converts pixel values within an image to their distance from the foreground of the image. 

The second python file (surf_norms.py) calculates the face normals of a triangulated surface. The final python script transformations.py, calculates and applies both rigid and affine transformations on a 3D image based on user inputed transformation parameters.
